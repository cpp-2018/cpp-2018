Probably don't read this code, because it's rushed and only need to work... Luckily, Elm code can be in a workable state without looking pretty. Yay Elm :raised_hands: 

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
You can find the more information [here](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app/blob/master/template/README.md).


#### How to build

 1. `elm app build`
 2. `mv build/index.html index.html`
 3. Prepend `/build` to all absolute paths in `index.html`
